            In a federation the powers and functions of the government are divided among two governments. 
            In India it is the Union Government and the various State Governments. However, with the passage 
            of 73rd and 74th amendment act of the Constitution of India, in 1993 the division of powers and 
            functions have been further trickled down to Local Self Governments (Panchayat at Village levels 
            and Municipalities and Municipal Corporations in towns and large cities). As such India now has not
             two but three tier of Governments in its federal setup.
